# Outline

Introduction:
- Predictive ecology and predicting interactions
- Data is scarce
- Idea you can train a predictive model on simulated data and apply it to real data and it makes good predictions
- It might seem wild that this can work, but here we show ....

Methods

- concept figure with (niche model, mpn) instead of (hypoth 1, 2)

- Empirical data from Streams in NZ
- Julia 1.6, EN, Flux, etc.

For each empirical network, we predict the interactions by training a neural network ---
structure of neural net todo . For each of these neural nets, we do not train them on any real data, but instead
only on simulated networks from each of the candidate models with $S_i$ species and betabinom connectance.

Summary stats to describe network properties are inevitably necessary.

- abc discussion and history
- generative learning discussion and history

explain why you can't predict interaction between two species based on
anything but summary stats.



We generate networks from various candidate models: cascade, niche, mpn, etc.
